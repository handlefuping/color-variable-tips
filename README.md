# theme-color README

you can type `$` to get the color variables tips

// Enable or disable this extension.

"colorvariabletips.enable": true

// Paths relative to workspace root.

"colorvariabletips.path": ["src/styles/theme/color.scss"]

// Defines the documents for which this provider is applicable.

"colorvariabletips.selector": ["html","css","less","sass","scss","vue","jsx","tsx"]

modifying the color variables file does not require reloading VSCode.

**Enjoy!**
